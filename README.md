# Arthropod associations with residual dry matter and foundations shrubs in California desert ecosystems

Pitfall traps were deployed along an aridity gradient in California to measure associations of ground-dwelling arthropods with foundation shrubs, and to assess the ability of residual dry matter (RDM) as an indicator of arthropod community structure.

## Getting Started

These instructions describe the contents of this repository and will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. *warning* arthropod identifications subject to change as morphospecies are IDed. 

See <a href = "https://jennabraun.github.io/rdm.gradient> repository webpage </a> for final work up 

### Data descriptions

* Raw Data folder holds excel workbooks used for data entry
* Clean Data folder holds .csv files for analysis along with metadata describing the variables

### Script descriptions
* cleaning.R takes the raw data workbooks as inputs and writes to clean data folder
* functions.R is a set of useful functions (calculating standard error, formating graphs)
* eda.R takes clean data as input and generates graphs & modelling
